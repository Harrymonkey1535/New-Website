<Div> <p class="main"> On Dec. 18, 2022, Argentina won the men's World Cup in the most dramatic way possible, beating France in a penalty shootout after a breathless 3-3 draw in Lusail, Qatar.<br> <br> 


The game was an instant classic, one of the best finals anyone could remember, packed with unforgettable moments. Lionel Messi delivered on the biggest stage of all, exorcising the ghosts of his 2014 heartbreak when Argentina were beaten in the World Cup final in Brazil. France's Kylian Mbappé scored a hat trick but still ended up on the losing side. Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez starred with a jaw-dropping, last-gasp added-time stop from France's Randal Kolo Muani before saving twice in the decisive shootout.<br> <pr></pr>

The win gave Argentina a third World Cup winners' star on their shirts, following victories in 1978 and 1986. Only Brazil (with five), Italy (four) and Germany (four) have more. It also helped Messi live up to the legacy of the football-obsessed country's other great hero -- and architect of their 1986 triumph -- Diego Maradona.<br>

<br>The drama of the final was a fitting end to Argentina's roller-coaster ride through the tournament. It started with a surprise 2-1 opening defeat to Saudi Arabia, bouncing back with nail-biting group-stage victories against Mexico and Poland, and then knockout stage wins over Australia, Netherlands -- in another shootout -- and 2018 finalists Croatia.
